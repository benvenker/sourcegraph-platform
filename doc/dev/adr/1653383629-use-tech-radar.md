# 3. Use Tech Radar

Date: 2022-05-24

### Context

We want a quick visual overview of our tech stack. We think this will improve developer onboarding as it will be easy to digest our stack for the new hires quickly.

Proposed & discussed on May 12 during the [Backend Crew meeting](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Y51d863Nuqr9BzbTbwwSF9jes0ro71vB724oc2p8qsQ/edit). Tech Radar is not unique for the back-end, and our ambition is to include both front-end and back-end tools, practices, libraries, etc.

### Decision

Build Sourcegraph Tech Radar. The initial version uses the [Build your Own Radar](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/byor) version hosted at Thoughtworks.com

### Consequences

- Improve understanding of our current tech stack.
- Improve onboarding.
